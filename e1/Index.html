		<h1>Not Quite 20 Questions:</h1>
		<h2>Question 1:</h2>
		<h3>What's the most overrated thing?</h3>
		<p>The most overrated thing is Cabybaras. They look like what would happen if every single mammal came together and made a default mammal.</p>
		<h2>Question 2:</h2>
		<h3>What's your favorite movie?</h3>
		<p>I do not watch that many movies but if I had to choose a favorite it would be Tick Tick Boom. It is a movie interpretation of a musical and I thought it was very well done and adapted well.</p>
		<h2>Question 3:</h2>
		<h3>Dream vacation spot?</h3>
		<p>My dream vacation spots are in Europe. More specifically, places like Rome, London, Paris, and places in Ireland.</p>
		<h2>Question 4:</h2>
		<h3>Are you a warm weather or cold weather person?</h3>
		<p>Cold weather person. I could always become warmer by wearing more and more clothes, gloves, hats, etc. It is much harder to become colder when you are too hot because there are way less remedies to being too hot.</p>
		<h2>Question 5:</h2>
		<h3>Favorite type of cuisine?</h3>
		<p>I love most all food and my favorite type of food changes on the day you ask me. Currently my favorite type of cuisine is sushi.</p>
		<h2>Question 6:</h2>
		<h3>Favorite animal?</h3>
		<p>My favorite animal are red pandas. Not for any particular reason I just think they are neat.</p>
		<h2>Question 7:</h2>
		<h3>Favorite font?</h3>
		<p>I don't have a specific favorite font but I do like fonts that prioritizes readability over style.</p>
		<h2>Question 8:</h2>
		<h3>If money wasn't an issue, what is the first item you would get that isn't an essential item?</h3>
		<p>The first thing I would get is a full race car simulation rig that has the physical feedback and car screen and everything. I dont have a passion for cars at all however because money is not an issue I think it would be a real cool thing to own and use.</p>
		<h2>Question 9:</h2>
		<h3>Dog or cat person?</h3>
		<p>I own both a dog and cat and I would say I am not specifically either a dog or cat person. However the first pet I want to own on my own is a cat because they are definitely easier to take care of.</p>
		<h2>Question 10:</h2>
		<h3>What is your favorite way to relax or detox?</h3>
		<p>I play videogames to relax and detox. It's also helps continuing my passion for game designing.</p>
		<h2>Question 11:</h2>
		<h3>What is a TV show you currently recommend?</h3>
		<p>I do not watch a lot of tv, however I can definetly reccomend Arcane on Netflix. It is definitely not for everyone because it is animated and based off of a videogame. However, I never played the videogame it is based off of and I still enjoyed it.</p>
		<h2>Question 12:</h2>
		<h3>Favorite season?</h3>
		<p>My favorite season is absolutely fall. Summer gets too hot and winter gets too cold. Spring has a load of allergens too. Fall is nice cool weather and pretty leaves. As an added bonus it fits with my outfit&#146;s aestetics.</p>
		<h2>Question 13:</h2>
		<h3>What did you do for winter break?</h3>
		<p>I mostly relaxed. Most all of my friends are from Virginia so when I go back to New Jersey for my break I do not typically do much other than work.</p>
		<h2>Question 14:</h2>
		<h3>What are your pet peeves?</h3>
		<p>Not respecting personal space. I am very specific on who I let into my personal space and I dislike people who are naturally physical. It becomes a lot less of an issue if I am close to them but even then even playful physical aggresion is a boundry of mine.</p>
		<h2>Question 15:</h2>
		<h3>What's your favorite game to play?</h3>
		<p>I have a lot of favorite games that I love but currently right now my favorite game to play is Warframe. Not because it is my favorite game but I am just really enjoying playing it right now.</p>
		<h2>Question 16:</h2>
		<h3>What is your favorite book genre?</h3>
		<p>I have not read a book in a very very long time. Back when I did read however I was very interested in mythology and books about mythology.</p>
		<h2>Question 17:</h2>
		<h3>What is your favorite song by an artist you don't generally listen to?</h3>
		<p><q>United in Grief</q> by Kendrick Lamar. I don't generally listen to rap, but Kendrick Lamar is typically the reason I come back to listen for a little bit before I go back to listening to alt rock and folk. To Pimp a Butterfly is also an amazing classic album by Kendrick Lamar too.</p>
		<h2>Question 18:</h2>
		<h3>Excluding any actual military figures from history, if you had a zombie army who would you make the general and why?</h3>
		<p>Batman. He is not a military figure but a brilliant tactition and was able to lead the justice league.</p>
		<h2>Question 19:</h2>
		<h3>What is your food hot take?</h3>
		<p>Filet mignon steak is not nearly as good as the price dictates it should be. Its not that great of a meat and the texture and flavor is just not as good as other meats like chicken and ham.</p>
